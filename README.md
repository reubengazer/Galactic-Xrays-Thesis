# Multi-Wavelength Identification of Galactic X-Ray Sources

This is a separated .pdf document of research I performed (in the field of stellar astrophysics) during the time period of 2015-2017.
All work was completed under the supervision of Dr. Craig O. Heinke at the University of Alberta.
If you have any questions or comments related to this work, please do not hesitate to contact me!

Here's a nice figure from this work, outlining the predicted stellar types of ~ 200 close-by stars that were classified as "single-stellar" as opposed to a high-energy binary. See Chapter 2 for details.

**Caption:** (left) The distribution of spectral classes from the best-fit spectral modeling for the single-stellar population (see Chapter 2). (right) The distribution and frequency of $E(B−V)$ for each spectral class. The size of the circle represents the number of sources occupying that class and $E(B−V)$. Extinction values in this case are generally positively correlated with the distance of the system from us.
